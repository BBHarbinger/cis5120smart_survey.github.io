							<h2> Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							User experience (UX) research relies heavily on understanding the thoughts, motivations, and pain points of target users. While interviews and surveys are crucial tools, they often have inherent limitations. Interviews can be time-consuming to conduct and analyze, and surveys can lack the depth to reveal truly meaningful insights.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our project seeks to address these shortcomings by introducing a revolutionary AI-powered system for creating and conducting semi-structured surveys. This system will dynamically adapt to interviewee responses in real-time, providing the depth of an interview with the scalability of a survey.

							<h2> Ideation</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The inspiration for this project came from recognizing a few key issues with traditional UX research methods:
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Static Questionnaires:</strong> Rigid surveys force users down a predetermined path, even if their responses indicate that a different line of questioning might be more fruitful.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Time-Intensive Analysis:</strong> Combining through interview transcripts and large quantities of survey data to uncover patterns is a manual and time-consuming process for researchers.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without the ability to adapt questioning in real-time, researchers may miss out on key insights that could provide a more complete picture of user needs.
						</p>

						<br>

						<p>
							We realized that an AI-driven solution could solve these problems. Consider these potential features:			</p>
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Adaptive Questioning:</strong>  The system could analyze responses and intelligently determine the most relevant follow-up questions, leading to more focused and insightful data collection.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Real-time Insights:</strong> As responses are collected, the AI could look for patterns and themes, providing researchers with valuable insights earlier in the process.						
						</p>

						<p>
							By combining these ideas, we aim to create a system that empowers UX researchers to collect richer, more actionable data, all while saving time and resources.

						<p>
							<strong>1. Correlation:</strong> Moderate positive correlation exists between noticing the character and less reported feeling of overwhelm. This suggests the character might play a role in calming users.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>2. No Significant Impact:</strong> No statistically significant correlation between character interaction and positive sentiment scores. Further investigation is needed to determine if a causal relationship exists.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>3. Design Insights:</strong> Users often notice the character, but color recognition and interaction rates need improvement. Sentiment is somewhat positive (especially regarding overwhelm), but the character can cause distraction and confusion.
						</p>

						<h3>Conclusions & Next Steps</h3>
						<p>
							To improve the design, we focused on:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>1. Visual Prominence:</strong> Increase the character's visibility for better color recognition.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>2. Intuitive Interaction:</strong> Implement interaction mechanisms that directly promote positive feelings.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>3. Minimizing Distraction:</strong> Reduce any distraction or confusion caused by the character, while maintaining its ability to ease potential anxiety.

						<p>
							Throughout this project, we developed an AI-powered survey system that breaks the constraints of traditional platforms. From our initial concept, iterative prototypes, rigorous user testing, and a final statistical evaluation, we've uncovered valuable lessons and opportunities. The dynamic questioning powered by our fine-tuned language model proved highly engaging for interviewees. Our results demonstrated the potential of a character/bot to reduce user anxiety during the interview process. Moving forward, we'll prioritize enhancing the character's visual prominence, creating intuitive and meaningful interactions, and striking the delicate balance between assistance and distraction. Ultimately, this project showcases the power of AI in revolutionizing user research methodologies, and we're excited to continue refining our solution to deliver truly user-centric and insightful survey experiences.
