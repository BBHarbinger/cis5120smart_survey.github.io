							<h2> Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							User experience (UX) research relies heavily on understanding the thoughts, motivations, and pain points of target users. While interviews and surveys are crucial tools, they often have inherent limitations. Interviews can be time-consuming to conduct and analyze, and surveys can lack the depth to reveal truly meaningful insights.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our project seeks to address these shortcomings by introducing a revolutionary AI-powered system for creating and conducting semi-structured surveys. This system will dynamically adapt to interviewee responses in real-time, providing the depth of an interview with the scalability of a survey.

							<h2> Ideation</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The inspiration for this project came from recognizing a few key issues with traditional UX research methods:
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Static Questionnaires:</strong> Rigid surveys force users down a predetermined path, even if their responses indicate that a different line of questioning might be more fruitful.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Time-Intensive Analysis:</strong> Combining through interview transcripts and large quantities of survey data to uncover patterns is a manual and time-consuming process for researchers.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without the ability to adapt questioning in real-time, researchers may miss out on key insights that could provide a more complete picture of user needs.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We realized that an AI-driven solution could solve these problems. Consider these potential features:			</p>
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Adaptive Questioning:</strong>  The system could analyze responses and intelligently determine the most relevant follow-up questions, leading to more focused and insightful data collection.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Real-time Insights:</strong> As responses are collected, the AI could look for patterns and themes, providing researchers with valuable insights earlier in the process.						
						</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							By combining these ideas, we aim to create a system that empowers UX researchers to collect richer, more actionable data, all while saving time and resources.

						<h2> Prototype Development & Review</h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							We began with paper prototypes to map out the core user flow, decision points, and how our adaptive logic would enhance their interaction with the survey. User testing at this early stage helped validate our question structure and refine the system for optimal clarity.						
						</p>
						<p>
							As we moved to high-fidelity prototypes, UX principles guided our visual design choices. We focused on an intuitive interface, clear navigation, and an aesthetically pleasing experience to ease the survey-taking process. User feedback was critical in ensuring these design elements resonated positively with participants. Finally, the interactive prototype allowed us to test the dynamic UI adjustments driven by the AI engine, ensuring a seamless and personalized UX. User testing was key in making sure the system felt intuitive and responsive.

							Through a user evaluation process, we refined our survey questions, established design guidelines, and implemented UI improvements including a skip option, updated icons, and a review page to enhance user control and clarity. This evaluation involved a diverse user panel consisting of a UX researcher, product manager, customer support representative, non-technical user, and technical user. Their valuable insights helped us identify the system's strengths in dynamic questioning and natural language processing (NLP) â€“  both of which streamline the interview and analysis processes for researchers.						
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the evaluation also revealed areas for improvement, particularly in accurately interpreting conversational nuances and accommodating diverse user needs.  To address these challenges, we envision a future iteration with an enhanced NLP algorithm and a more robust user profiling system, ultimately delivering personalized and inclusive experiences. The feedback from our evaluators will be instrumental in guiding these advancements and ensuring the system remains effective and user-friendly for all potential interviewees.						
						</p>
						<p>
							We improved the questions and set up guidelines. Add a skip for interviewee, add the updated mark/icon, add a review page.

					<!-- Final Evaluation-->
					<article id="main" class="container special">
						
						<h3><strong>4. Final Evaluation</strong></h3>

						<p>
							Feedback revealed the interface's overall ease of use but also pinpointed opportunities to enhance the questionnaire's interactivity and clarity. We'll incorporate tooltips or modals to  explain question purposes and the impact of skipping, empowering users with informed decision-making. Additionally, we'll refine the questionnaire's feedback mechanisms to provide greater acknowledgment of user input and progress, boosting engagement.  It's clear from the tests that we need improved prompts, documentation, and perhaps tutorials to clarify LLM concepts and how they differ from traditional survey systems. Potentially showcasing output early in the process could further clarify the system's value.  Long-term, we see immense potential in leveraging LLM to further assist users in question design and analysis.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the interviewee side, while the added skip function enhanced user control, we'll address limited interaction with the character.  Animations, visual enhancements, and the planned introduction of voice input should increase engagement, ease of use, and accessibility.

						<p>
							These insightful user responses drive our next steps, ensuring that the survey system is not just intuitive but truly empowers both interviewers and interviewees throughout the process.
						</p>
						<br>


						<h3>Design Question</h3>
						<p>
							We sought to understand how we can maintain UI simplicity while enhancing user interaction, with a specific focus on the potential impact of a character/bot within the interviewee experience.
						</p>
						<br>


						<h3>Study Plan</h3>
						<p>
							Design Question: Does the presence of a character positively impact the interviewee experience?
						</p>
						<br>


						<h3>Independent Variable:</h3>
						<p>
							Version A: Interviewee interface includes character/bot with interaction elements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Version B: Interviewee interface has a standard chat box without a character.
						</p>
						<br>

						<h3>Feedback & Analysis</h3>
						<p>
							1. Correlation: Moderate positive correlation exists between noticing the character and less reported feeling of overwhelm. This suggests the character might play a role in calming users.
						</p>
						<p>
							2. No Significant Impact: No statistically significant correlation between character interaction and positive sentiment scores. Further investigation is needed to determine if a causal relationship exists.
						</p>
						<p>
							3. Design Insights: Users often notice the character, but color recognition and interaction rates need improvement. Sentiment is somewhat positive (especially regarding overwhelm), but the character can cause distraction and confusion.
						</p>
						<br>


						<h3>Conclusions & Next Steps</h3>
						<p>
							To improve the design, we focused on:
						</p>
						<p>
							1. Visual Prominence: Increase the character's visibility for better color recognition.
						</p>
						<p>
							2. Intuitive Interaction: Implement interaction mechanisms that directly promote positive feelings.
						</p>
						<p>
							3. Minimizing Distraction: Reduce any distraction or confusion caused by the character, while maintaining its ability to ease potential anxiety.
						</p>
