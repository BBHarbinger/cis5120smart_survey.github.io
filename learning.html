							User experience (UX) research relies heavily on understanding the thoughts, motivations, and pain points of target users. While interviews and surveys are crucial tools, they often have inherent limitations. Interviews can be time-consuming to conduct and analyze, and surveys can lack the depth to reveal truly meaningful insights.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our project seeks to address these shortcomings by introducing a revolutionary AI-powered system for creating and conducting semi-structured surveys. This system will dynamically adapt to interviewee responses in real-time, providing the depth of an interview with the scalability of a survey.

							The inspiration for this project came from recognizing a few key issues with traditional UX research methods:
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Static Questionnaires:</strong> Rigid surveys force users down a predetermined path, even if their responses indicate that a different line of questioning might be more fruitful.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Time-Intensive Analysis:</strong> Combining through interview transcripts and large quantities of survey data to uncover patterns is a manual and time-consuming process for researchers.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without the ability to adapt questioning in real-time, researchers may miss out on key insights that could provide a more complete picture of user needs.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We realized that an AI-driven solution could solve these problems. Consider these potential features:			</p>
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Adaptive Questioning:</strong>  The system could analyze responses and intelligently determine the most relevant follow-up questions, leading to more focused and insightful data collection.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Real-time Insights:</strong> As responses are collected, the AI could look for patterns and themes, providing researchers with valuable insights earlier in the process.						
						</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							By combining these ideas, we aim to create a system that empowers UX researchers to collect richer, more actionable data, all while saving time and resources.

							We began with paper prototypes to map out the core user flow, decision points, and how our adaptive logic would enhance their interaction with the survey. User testing at this early stage helped validate our question structure and refine the system for optimal clarity.						
						</p>
						<p>
							As we moved to high-fidelity prototypes, UX principles guided our visual design choices. We focused on an intuitive interface, clear navigation, and an aesthetically pleasing experience to ease the survey-taking process. User feedback was critical in ensuring these design elements resonated positively with participants. Finally, the interactive prototype allowed us to test the dynamic UI adjustments driven by the AI engine, ensuring a seamless and personalized UX. User testing was key in making sure the system felt intuitive and responsive.
						</p>

						<!-- Lo-Fi Prototyping -->
						<h3><strong>1. Lo-Fi Prototyping</strong></h3>

						<p>
							We began with two distinct hand-drawn paper prototypes to explore different UI designs and workflows for our AI-powered survey system. This approach adhered to the low-fidelity, modular principles of the assignment, allowing us to focus on core functionality and interaction concepts. Key design considerations included question branching, skip logic, response analysis markers, and the addition of a review page for participants. These prototypes were essential in testing different approaches and ensuring flexibility in the design.

							Through a user evaluation process, we refined our survey questions, established design guidelines, and implemented UI improvements including a skip option, updated icons, and a review page to enhance user control and clarity. This evaluation involved a diverse user panel consisting of a UX researcher, product manager, customer support representative, non-technical user, and technical user. Their valuable insights helped us identify the system's strengths in dynamic questioning and natural language processing (NLP) â€“  both of which streamline the interview and analysis processes for researchers.						
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the evaluation also revealed areas for improvement, particularly in accurately interpreting conversational nuances and accommodating diverse user needs.  To address these challenges, we envision a future iteration with an enhanced NLP algorithm and a more robust user profiling system, ultimately delivering personalized and inclusive experiences. The feedback from our evaluators will be instrumental in guiding these advancements and ensuring the system remains effective and user-friendly for all potential interviewees.						
						</p>
						<p>
							We improved the questions and set up guidelines. Add a skip for interviewee, add the updated mark/icon, add a review page.
