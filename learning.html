							User experience (UX) research relies heavily on understanding the thoughts, motivations, and pain points of target users. While interviews and surveys are crucial tools, they often have inherent limitations. Interviews can be time-consuming to conduct and analyze, and surveys can lack the depth to reveal truly meaningful insights.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our project seeks to address these shortcomings by introducing a revolutionary AI-powered system for creating and conducting semi-structured surveys. This system will dynamically adapt to interviewee responses in real-time, providing the depth of an interview with the scalability of a survey.

							The inspiration for this project came from recognizing a few key issues with traditional UX research methods:
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Static Questionnaires:</strong> Rigid surveys force users down a predetermined path, even if their responses indicate that a different line of questioning might be more fruitful.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Time-Intensive Analysis:</strong> Combining through interview transcripts and large quantities of survey data to uncover patterns is a manual and time-consuming process for researchers.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without the ability to adapt questioning in real-time, researchers may miss out on key insights that could provide a more complete picture of user needs.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We realized that an AI-driven solution could solve these problems. Consider these potential features:			</p>
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Adaptive Questioning:</strong>  The system could analyze responses and intelligently determine the most relevant follow-up questions, leading to more focused and insightful data collection.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Real-time Insights:</strong> As responses are collected, the AI could look for patterns and themes, providing researchers with valuable insights earlier in the process.						
						</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							By combining these ideas, we aim to create a system that empowers UX researchers to collect richer, more actionable data, all while saving time and resources.

						<!-- Lo-Fi Prototyping -->
						<h3><strong>1. Lo-Fi Prototyping</strong></h3>

						<p>
							We began with two distinct hand-drawn paper prototypes to explore different UI designs and workflows for our AI-powered survey system. This approach adhered to the low-fidelity, modular principles of the assignment, allowing us to focus on core functionality and interaction concepts. Key design considerations included question branching, skip logic, response analysis markers, and the addition of a review page for participants. These prototypes were essential in testing different approaches and ensuring flexibility in the design.

							Through a user evaluation process, we refined our survey questions, established design guidelines, and implemented UI improvements including a skip option, updated icons, and a review page to enhance user control and clarity. This evaluation involved a diverse user panel consisting of a UX researcher, product manager, customer support representative, non-technical user, and technical user. Their valuable insights helped us identify the system's strengths in dynamic questioning and natural language processing (NLP) â€“  both of which streamline the interview and analysis processes for researchers.						
						</p>
						<p>
							However, the evaluation also revealed areas for improvement, particularly in accurately interpreting conversational nuances and accommodating diverse user needs.  To address these challenges, we envision a future iteration with an enhanced NLP algorithm and a more robust user profiling system, ultimately delivering personalized and inclusive experiences. The feedback from our evaluators will be instrumental in guiding these advancements and ensuring the system remains effective and user-friendly for all potential interviewees.						
						</p>
						<p>
							We improved the questions and set up guidelines. Add a skip for interviewee, add the updated mark/icon, add a review page.

						<!-- Heuristic Evaluation -->
						<h3><strong>Heuristic Evaluation</strong></h3>

						<p>
							Our heuristic evaluation identified several areas for improvement to enhance the overall user experience of our survey system. 
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Clarity and Conciseness:</strong>  Evaluators suggested emphasizing the survey's purpose and condensing the "Research Background" section for clarity.  Additionally, it's essential to refine the wording of questions, replacing any complex terminology that might confuse interviewees.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>NPC Functionality: </strong> The NPC interaction should feel natural and valuable. If evaluators found it distracting, we should consider streamlining its role or simplifying prompts.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Progress Tracking and Input:</strong>  Clear progress indicators and intuitive input fields are essential. Feedback highlighting any confusion about survey length or difficulty entering responses will guide refinements to these elements.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Visuals and Error Handling:</strong> An aesthetically pleasing interface that guides navigation is important.  Any specific feedback on visual elements should be incorporated. We'll also need to enhance error handling with informative messages.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>NPC Timing and Support:</strong>  If the NPC provides instructions or commentary, the timing must align seamlessly with the survey flow. We should also explore adding hints or explanations for various setting options within the question guidelines.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Help and documentation:</strong>  The question guideline should have some hint or explanation for different setting buttons.						
						</p>

						<hr>

						<!-- Revision Plan -->
						<h3><strong>Revision Plan</strong></h3>

						<p>
							After the evaluation, we made the following revision plan.						
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Text Clarity:</strong> Revise the survey's instructions and questions to simplify language and eliminate ambiguity.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>NPC Interaction: </strong> Streamline or modify the NPC's role based on feedback. Evaluate its value proposition within the survey experience.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Progress Feedback:</strong>  Enhance progress tracking using clearer indicators to inform users of their position in the survey.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Response Input:</strong> Explore alternative response mechanisms (dropdowns, sliders, etc.) to improve the intuitiveness of providing answers.
						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">
							<strong>Visual Design:</strong>  Optimize color scheme, font, and layout for readability and engagement, ensuring mobile responsiveness.						</p>
						<p class="with-dot">

						<h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>

						<p>
							Feedback revealed the interface's overall ease of use but also pinpointed opportunities to enhance the questionnaire's interactivity and clarity. We'll incorporate tooltips or modals to  explain question purposes and the impact of skipping, empowering users with informed decision-making. Additionally, we'll refine the questionnaire's feedback mechanisms to provide greater acknowledgment of user input and progress, boosting engagement.  It's clear from the tests that we need improved prompts, documentation, and perhaps tutorials to clarify LLM concepts and how they differ from traditional survey systems. Potentially showcasing output early in the process could further clarify the system's value.  Long-term, we see immense potential in leveraging LLM to further assist users in question design and analysis.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the interviewee side, while the added skip function enhanced user control, we'll address limited interaction with the character.  Animations, visual enhancements, and the planned introduction of voice input should increase engagement, ease of use, and accessibility.
							</p>
						<p>
							These insightful user responses drive our next steps, ensuring that the survey system is not just intuitive but truly empowers both interviewers and interviewees throughout the process.
